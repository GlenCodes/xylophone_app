# Xylophone

This is a Flutter app built (in the dart language).
Relatively simple, the app plays a sound file in response to Flat buttons being pressed

It in part acheives this by importing an audio_cache dart library to make use of.

This was the result from a class taught by the good folks at London App Brewery.
